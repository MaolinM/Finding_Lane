The code for traffic sign recognition is in "traffic_signs.ipynb". It first preprocessed the traffic signs' images to grayscale, then used image augmentation to address the 
differences between the amounts of data in all classes, and utilized the images to train a CNN model. And the accuracy in the test set reached 97%.

The file "MNIST.ipynb" is for hand-written digit recognition. I wrote it to better understand CNN and MNIST dataset.
